- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoobOfAll
- 👀 I’m interested in developing Open Source ideas, I am more of tech-user rather than a coder. I come from Business background and I wish to use that skill to develop open source ideas to help the core philosophy of open source.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create an entire eco-system of open source life. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating ideas that focus on impact rather than profit
- 📫 How to reach me - My Social media
